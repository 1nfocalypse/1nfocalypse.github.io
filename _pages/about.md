Hi! Thank you for visiting my site!

I'm a hobbyist cryptographer and systems developer. I particularly enjoy PRNGs, international crypto, and deniable cryptography.
Some things I've done:
- Upstreamed Philox Engine to GCC's libstdc++-v3 for C++26
- Spoke at DEFCON 33 via the Crypto Privacy Village on PRNG design, use, and exploitation
- Authored a survey also on PRNG design, use, and exploitation, including implementations and demos
- Wrote the modern crypto track for a black badge CTF @ DEFCON 33 ("? Cube")

Some things I'm currently doing:
- Implementing a portable 128 bit unsigned type for Philox Engine in GCC
- Authoring a survey of Chinese and Russian cryptologic standards + academic implementations
- Tinkering with a new sender-deniable symmetric scheme
- Cryptanalyzing Philox

Some additional things about me:
I'm a bit of a cyberpunk nerd, and enjoy hardcore electronic genres. I'm a big fan of open source (particularly free) software,
as well as privacy-centric projects like Signal. My primary languages of choice are C++ and Python, although I have written code in
JavaScript, Java, Haskell, C, and R besides that. I'm also interested in numerics, and hope to contribute to libstdc++-v3's <linalg>
header and the surrounding components once I've concluded work for Philox Engine. It's also my solemn duty to shill Void Linux whenever
possible, so consider that part accomplished.
